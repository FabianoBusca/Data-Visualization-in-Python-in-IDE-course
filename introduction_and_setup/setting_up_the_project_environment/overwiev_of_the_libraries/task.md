## Objective
Set up the environment for the project by installing the necessary libraries. In this task, we will provide an overview of the libraries we'll use throughout the course and guide you on setting up your project environment.

## Libraries Overview

1. **Seaborn**: A data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

2. **Matplotlib**: A foundational plotting library in Python. It offers a lot of control over plot elements and serves as the base for Seaborn.

3. **Plotly**: A library for creating interactive visualizations. It’s especially useful if we want to make our charts interactive, allowing us to hover over data points, zoom, and more.

## Task Instructions

1. **Set Up Your Environment**
   - Ensure you are using Python 3.9 or later.
   - Create a virtual environment for the project (recommended).

2. **Install Seaborn**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to install Seaborn:
     ```bash
     pip install seaborn
     ```

3. **Verify Installation**
   - After installing, open `main.py` and run the code to check that Seaborn was installed correctly.

## Next Steps
Once you have confirmed the libraries are installed, proceed to Lesson 1.2, where we’ll load and explore the dataset.
