## Objective
In this task, you will install additional libraries (`matplotlib`, and `pandas`) and write code to verify that each library is correctly installed. This will help set up your environment to work with data visualization and manipulation.

## Libraries Overview

1. **Matplotlib**: A foundational plotting library for Python, which is the base for Seaborn.
3. **Pandas**: Essential for data manipulation, loading, and preparation.

## Task Instructions

1. **Install Required Libraries**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the bah command to install `matplotlib` and `pandas`

2. **Write Code to Verify Installation**
   - Open `task.py`.
   - Complete the function `verify_libraries()` so it tries to import each library (`matplotlib` and `pandas`).

## Additional Resources

Refer to the official documentation for each library if you encounter any issues or would like to learn more about their features:

- [Matplotlib Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/quick_start.html)
- [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/index.html)

These resources will provide guidance on installation, troubleshooting, and usage tips for each library.
