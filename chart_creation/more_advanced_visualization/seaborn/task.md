In this lesson, we’ll learn how to create more advanced bar charts in Seaborn, specifically a grouped bar chart. Grouped bar charts are useful when you want to compare the count or mean of a particular metric across multiple categories and sub-categories. 

For example, a grouped bar chart can show the number of games released in different genres across multiple platforms.

## Key Concepts

1. **Data Structure for Grouped Bar Charts**: To create a grouped bar chart, the data should contain multiple categories that will define the x-axis (e.g., platforms) and hues (e.g., genres).

2. **Seaborn’s `countplot` and `barplot`**: Seaborn has `countplot` for showing the count of occurrences and `barplot` for displaying averages or sums across different categories.

3. **Customization**: You can easily customize the chart using various Seaborn and Matplotlib parameters like `hue`, `palette`, `xlabel`, and `ylabel` to make the chart more informative.
