**Objective**: Using Seaborn, create a grouped bar chart that displays the count of games for each `year_of_release` split by `rating`.

**Instructions**:

1. Load the dataset and prepare it for the visualization.
2. Create the Grouped Bar Chart using `year_of_release` on the x-axis and `rating` as the hue.
3. Add labels, a title, and rotate the x-axis labels for clarity.
