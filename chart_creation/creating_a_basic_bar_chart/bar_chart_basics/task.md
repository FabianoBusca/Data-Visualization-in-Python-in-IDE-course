A **bar chart** is one of the most commonly used data visualization types, especially helpful for comparing categorical data. Each category is represented by a bar, and the height or length of each bar corresponds to the value associated with that category. 

**Key Components of a Bar Chart:**
1. **Categories**: The different categories being compared.
2. **Values**: The quantity or measurement corresponding to each category.
3. **Bar Color and Width**: These can be customized for aesthetics or clarity.

We’ll use **Matplotlib** in this lesson for creating our bar chart.

**Matplotlib’s `plt.bar()` function:**
- **`plt.bar(x, height, color)`** is the function for creating a bar chart.
- **Parameters**:
  - `x`: The categories for each bar.
  - `height`: The values for each category.
  - `color`: Customizable color for the bars.
