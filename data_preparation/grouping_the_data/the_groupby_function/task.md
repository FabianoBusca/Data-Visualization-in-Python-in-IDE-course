## Objective
In this lesson, you will learn how to group data in `pandas` using the `groupby()` function. Grouping is essential for analyzing trends and patterns within categories, like platforms or genres in our dataset. By the end of this lesson, youâ€™ll know how to group data by one or multiple columns, calculate aggregate statistics, and filter groups based on certain conditions.

## Concepts Covered

1. **Grouping by a Single Column**  
   - Use `groupby()` to group data by a single column. This is useful when you want to calculate statistics for each category, such as the average user count per platform.

2. **Grouping by Multiple Columns**  
   - Grouping by multiple columns allows you to create subgroups and apply aggregate functions to each subgroup. For example, you could group by both platform and genre.

3. **Aggregating Data**  
   - After grouping, use functions like `mean()`, `sum()`, or `count()` to calculate statistics for each group. These functions make it easy to summarize data within each group.

4. **Filtering Groups**  
   - After grouping and aggregating, you can filter groups to display only those that meet specific conditions, such as groups with a high number of games or a high average rating.
